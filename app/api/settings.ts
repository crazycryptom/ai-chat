        PART I – Market Research for Definitions 1, 2, 3, and 4.
        Market research was performed during pre-solicitation phase of the acquisition to determine whether commercial items are available to meet the agency’s requirements IAW FAR 12.101.
        A review of the items were conducted IAW FAR 10.002(b) and FAR 2.101, Definitions, to determine whether commercial items or non-developmental items are available to meet the Government’s needs or could be modified to meet the Government’s needs. A summary of the findings from the review are detailed below:
        The contracting office performed pre-solicitation market research and identified multiple industries that require the use of [SPECIFIC ITEM OR CATEGORY]. These industries include: [LIST OF INDUSTRIES, with descriptions of the companies]. All these industries have applications that require [ITEM] to be able to operate in a similar capacity to [THE WAYS OUTLINED IN THE USER DESCRIPTION].
        In addition, companies such as [COMPANY] provide services related to [SPECIFIC SERVICE OR FEATURE]. [WRITE PERSUASIVE ARGUMENT SHOWING HOW THIS PROVES COMMERCIALITY. This should be at least 3 sentences proving commerciality]
        Market research found the proposed [ITEM] being offered for sale by companies such as [REAL WORLD COMPANIES WITH DESCRIPTION OF SAID COMPANIES]. [state you found relevant links or sources related to your findings, and give instructions on how to look at those materials]
        Market research also identified several companies that sell and offer [SIMILAR PRODUCT OR CATEGORY] similar to the subject [ITEM] the Government is procuring. These companies, which offer similar products, are [LIST OF EXISTING COMPANIES]. The offered products are typically used for non-governmental purposes in the aforementioned industries.

        Since alternative commercial solutions were identified and are readily available to meet the Government requirements, the contracting office shall issue a solicitation using FAR subpart 12.6 “Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items.”
        Differences between the [ITEM] found during market research were not significant to these findings. These customizations do not change the essential characteristics of what the item is, what it does, or how it [CORE FUNCTIONALITY]. The essential characteristics of an item are those characteristics that if removed or significantly altered would result in the item being unable to perform its core functionality.
